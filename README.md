# CMLS - Homework 2
This chorus plugin was developed using JUCE framework in C++ for the course of Computer Music - Languages and Systems at the Politecnico of Milan.
The interface was created using https://github.com/ffAudio/foleys_gui_magic and is stored inside the XML file.

#How to build?
On Windows:

    Download Juce (http://www.juce.com/)
    Open with Projucer the .jucer file.
    Save and open in your IDE. I used Visual Studio.
    Compile and generate VST3 file, that you'll find in your build folder.
    Load the VST3 in your DAW or use the plugin host provided by JUCE.
    Have fun!
